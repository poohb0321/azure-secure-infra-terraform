# **Azure Secure Infrastructure with Terraform**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project provisions a **secure Azure infrastructure** using Terraform, implementing best security practices for Identity & Access Management (IAM), network security, logging, and compliance enforcement.  

## **ðŸš€ Features Implemented**  
âœ… **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
- Configured **Azure AD Roles & Policies** for least-privilege access.  
- Enforced **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for users and service principals.  
- Defined **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for resource groups & subscriptions.  

âœ… **Network Security**  
- Provisioned **Azure Virtual Network (VNet) with Subnets** for segmentation.  
- Deployed **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to restrict inbound/outbound traffic.  
- Configured **Azure Firewall & DDoS Protection** for enhanced security.  
- Implemented **VPN Gateway** for secure remote access.  

âœ… **Security Monitoring & Compliance**  
- Integrated **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for threat protection.  
- Enabled **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics** for real-time monitoring.  
- Configured **Security Center Policies** to ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks.  

âœ… **Data Protection**  
- Enforced **Azure Storage Encryption (SSE)** with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs).  
- Enabled **Private Endpoints** for secure access to storage & databases.  
- Configured **Azure Key Vault** for secret management.  

âœ… **Automation & CI/CD**  
- Automated deployment with **Terraform & Azure DevOps Pipelines**.  
- Version-controlled infrastructure using **GitHub & Terraform Cloud**.
